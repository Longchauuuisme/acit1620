            <h1>History of Creation</h1>
            <p>
                Discord was created by Jason Citron, who was inspired by his own experiences with multiplayer games like <em>World of Warcraft</em>. He wanted to create a platform that would allow gamers to communicate and coordinate more easily while playing together. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The first version of Discord was released in 2015, and it quickly gained popularity among gamers for its ease of use and high-quality voice chat features. Since then, Discord has expanded to include text chat, video chat, and screen sharing, making it a versatile platform for all types of online communication.
            </p>
            <p>
                Discord has also become popular outside of the gaming community, with many people using it for work, school, and socializing. The platform has a strong focus on privacy and security, with end-to-end encryption for all messages and calls.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Discord has over 250 million users worldwide and continues to grow in popularity. The platform is constantly being updated with new features and improvements, making it one of the most popular communication tools on the internet.
